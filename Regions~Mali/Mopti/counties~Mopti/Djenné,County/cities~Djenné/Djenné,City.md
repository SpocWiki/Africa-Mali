> **Djenné** (Bambara: ߖߍ߬ߣߍ߫, romanized: Jɛ̀nɛ́; also known as Djénné, Jenné, and Jenne) 
> is a Songhai town and urban commune in the Inland Niger Delta region of central Mali. 
> 
> The town is the administrative centre of the Djenné Cercle, one of the eight subdivisions of the Mopti Region. 
> The commune includes ten of the surrounding villages and in 2009 had a population of 32,944.
>
> The history of Djenné is closely linked with that of Timbuktu. 
> Between the 15th and 17th centuries much of the trans-Saharan trade in goods such as salt, gold, 
> and slaves that moved in and out of Timbuktu passed through Djenné. 
> 
> Both towns became centres of Islamic scholarship. 
> Djenné's prosperity depended on this trade 
> and when the Portuguese established trading posts on the African coast, 
> the importance of the trans-Saharan trade and thus of Djenné declined.
>
> The town is famous for its distinctive adobe architecture, 
> most notably the Great Mosque which was built in 1907 on the site of an earlier mosque. 
> To the south of the town is Djenné-Djenno, the site of one of the oldest known towns in sub-Saharan Africa. 
> It is one of the oldest cities in Mali and West Africa as well as oldest continuously inhabited cities in the World. 
> Djenné together with Djenné-Djenno were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.
